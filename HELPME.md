# Java Library Management Application

This Java application is designed for managing a library, utilizing Hibernate for MySQL database connectivity, Spring for dependency management, and Postman for API testing with JSON request bodies. The application provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying books in the library.

## Description

The Java Library Management Application offers a robust solution for library management tasks, allowing librarians and administrators to efficiently manage their book collections. By leveraging Hibernate, the application seamlessly integrates with a MySQL database, enabling smooth data operations. Spring facilitates dependency injection and provides a flexible framework for building and configuring the application components. Additionally, Postman serves as a reliable tool for testing the application's API endpoints, allowing users to simulate various HTTP requests and verify the responses.

## Features

- **Book Management:** Easily add, update, delete, and view books in the library collection.
- **Hibernate Integration:** Utilize Hibernate ORM for seamless interaction with the MySQL database, simplifying data access and manipulation.
- **Spring Dependency Injection:** Leverage Spring's dependency injection mechanism for managing component dependencies and promoting loosely coupled design.
- **API Testing with Postman:** Test the application's API endpoints using Postman, enabling comprehensive testing of CRUD operations and ensuring API functionality and reliability.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

The Java Library Management Application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

- **Controller:** Receives user input and invokes appropriate methods on the service layer. In this application, the controllers handle HTTP requests, process input data, and delegate business logic to the service layer.

- **Service:** Contains the business logic of the application and coordinates the interaction between the controller and the repository layer. In this application, the service layer implements operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving books from the database.

- **Repository:** Handles data access and manipulation, interacting directly with the database. In this application, the repository layer uses Hibernate to perform CRUD operations on the MySQL database.
